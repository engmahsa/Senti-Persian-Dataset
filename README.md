# Senti-Persian-Dataset

**Senti-Persian** is a novel Sentiment Analysis (SA) dataset in Persian, designed to address the challenges of low-resource languages by leveraging advanced data augmentation techniques. This dataset includes 67,743 public comments from Iranian websites (Namava, Filimo, Aparat) and social media platforms (YouTube, Twitter, Instagram), annotated with sentiment labels: **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral**.

## Key Features

- **Size**: 67,743 labeled movie review comments.
- **Sources**: Comments are collected from popular Iranian websites (Namava, Filimo, Aparat) and social media platforms (YouTube, Twitter, Instagram).
- **Sentiment Labels**: Each comment is labeled as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
- **Data Augmentation**: Includes synthetic data generated using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach, specifically designed for Persian linguistics.
- **Performance Boost**: When used with the augmented dataset, sentiment analysis models achieve a significant improvement in accuracyâ€”from **88.4%** (original dataset) to **96%** (augmented dataset).

## Data Augmentation Methodology

The dataset incorporates a novel text augmentation model based on GANs:
- **Generator**: Designed to follow the linguistic properties of Persian.
- **Discriminator**: Evaluates the quality of synthetic data using cosine similarity of vectorized sentences (CLS-embeddings from BERT).

This method ensures that the augmented data maintains semantic consistency with the original dataset while increasing its volume and variety.

## Usage

The dataset is available in two versions:
1. **Original Dataset**: Contains the raw, manually annotated comments.
2. **Augmented Dataset**: Includes both the original comments and synthetic data generated via the GAN-based augmentation technique.To use the dataset, download it from the following link:

## Results

| Dataset Version       | Accuracy |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Original Dataset      | 88.4%    |
| Augmented Dataset     | 96%      |

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our GAN-based augmentation method in improving model performance.
